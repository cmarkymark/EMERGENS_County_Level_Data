## What Is In This Folder

Annual county-level overdose death counts are only publicly available (via the CDC Wonder database) for county X years with at least 10 overdose deaths, as a matter of human subjects protections. Research teams can request restricted mortality data from the CDC in the form of individual death records for the entire year. If the request is approved, research teams can use this mortality data to generate the annual county-level overdose death counts. The code in this folder will handle converting the restricted death records into annual county-level overdose death counts.

## Adapting this Code

Notably, this code can be used to look at any underlying death codes contained in the mortality record. So, if you wanted to look at, say, heart attack related deaths, you could identify the specific mortality codes and use this code to generate county-level heart attack-related death counts.
