## In this Folder

This folder contains geography data relevant to the dataset. Notably, the county_distances file is too large to be uploaded to github so a zipped version has been supplied.
The county distances and county adjacency files are used for generating the overdose gravity variable used in our studies. They may also be useful if you opt to 
undertake any type of spatial modeling.
